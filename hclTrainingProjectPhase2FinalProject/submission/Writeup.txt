This program registers and logs in a User with a username, password, and email. It utilizes JSP, 
servlets, and Hibernate to do the required workflow. The registration.html will forward it to a servlet
which will then handle the registration using Hibernate. The login.html will forward it to a JSP to 
validate the user login. Upon successful log in the session name will be presented with a log out
button. 

I began by creating an interface called UserDao which the UserService will implement. The functions that
need to be implemented is only registration which will take in a User object. The User object is a pojo
with various fields such as id, name, password, and email. Furthermore, the servlet.Registration will handle 
the data processing. Lastly, a hibernate.cfg.xml file is made to interact with the H2 database. 

By writing this program, I have displayed various skills I have learned. I utilized the Eclipse IDE which 
helped me write my program as well as used Git for version control. Apache Tom Cat was utilized as the 
web server, HTML pages for the front end, and servlets for back end processing.
