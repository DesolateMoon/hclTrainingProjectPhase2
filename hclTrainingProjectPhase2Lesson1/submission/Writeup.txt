This program validates a User Login. It is a servlet-based web application that shows a login page 
validates it. The correct values are hard-coded as there is no database invovled here. Upon a successful 
login, a dashboard page is shown. The dashboard will provide a link for l ogging out. Additionally, 
incorrect logins will be handled by showing an error message on the page. There is no database involved 
here. 

I began by creating an interface called UserDao which the service.Login will implement. The functions that
need to be implemented is only login which will take in a model.login object. The login object is a pojo
with two strings to hold username and password. Lastly, the servlet.login will handle the data processing.

By writing this program, I have displayed various skills I have learned. I utilized the Eclipse IDE which 
helped me write my program as well as used Git for version control. Apache Tom Cat was utilized as the 
web server, HTML pages for the front end, and servlets for back end processing.
