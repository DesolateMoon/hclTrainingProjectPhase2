This program is a servlet-based web application that shows a form to enter product detials. It then captures 
the details of a product in a servlet and then displays to the user the data that was entered. 

I began by creating an index.jsp which takes in the neccessary fields. In this case it was the name of the 
product, department, and cost. This will then interact with a servlet in the background called Capture. The
servlet will process the data and then display a table of the User's input. 

By writing this program, I have displayed various skills I have learned. I utilized the Eclipse IDE which 
helped me write my program as well as used Git for version control. Apache Tom Cat was utilized as the 
web server, JSP pages for the front end, and servlets for back end processing.
