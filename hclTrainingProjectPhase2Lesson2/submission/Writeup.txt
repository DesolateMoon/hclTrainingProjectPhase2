This program retrieves the product details using the product id. It is a servlet-based application that 
shows a form to enter a product ID. The product ID is then validated, and product details are retrieved
from the H2 database and displayed to the user. The product table in ithe H2 database is prepopulated with
data using JDBC. The data processing will also be done using JDBC. 

I began by creating a JDBC called DBConnection to create a table as well as prepopulate it. The prepopulated
fields will be represented by the Product class. Thus, the POJO will match the database holding an id,
name, department, and cost. Lastly, the JDBC called Retrieve will handle all the data processing to check
if the user's input is valid aka if the id inputted matches any of the ids in the database.

By writing this program, I have displayed various skills I have learned. I utilized the Eclipse IDE which 
helped me write my program as well as used Git for version control. Apache Tom Cat was utilized as the 
web server, HTML pages for the front end, and JDBC for back end processing.
