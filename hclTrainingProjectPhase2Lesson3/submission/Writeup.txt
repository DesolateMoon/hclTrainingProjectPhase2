This program adds a new product into the database. It is a servlet-based web application that shows a 
form to add new products. A H2 database will be created to store product data. The form data will be 
validated, and a row will be added to the database. The ID will be auto incremented. All database processing
will be done using Hibernate.

I began by creating a model for the Products. It is a simple POJO that holds id, name, department, and cost.
This is also reflective of the Lesson2. I then made a Registration servlet which will delegate to Hibernate 
Utility to create Session Factory. The Session Factory will open sessions. The Registration servlet will
interact with the H2 database and will display a table upon successful insertion into the database.  Lastly, 
a hibernate.cfg.xml file is made to interact with the H2 database. 

By writing this program, I have displayed various skills I have learned. I utilized the Eclipse IDE which 
helped me write my program as well as used Git for version control. Apache Tom Cat was utilized as the 
web server, HTML pages for the front end, servlet for back end processing, and Hibernate to store data
into the database.
